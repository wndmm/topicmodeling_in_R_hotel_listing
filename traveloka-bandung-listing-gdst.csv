Rizal P.,9.4,28-Mar-22,"First time stays at this really central located hotel, we booked the Deluxe City View and asked for the high floor to have a better view, it was really a stunning view from the balcony and window. They gave us the room no 1032, its headed to East (just in front of the Gasibu park) and the side window is headed to North (Dago and Mt Tangkuban Perahu view). The room size is just perfect with large modern IPTV and other facilities but the bathroom size is really small (1x1,5) for a 5* hotel, even the 4* hotel have much bigger bathroom. The other issues is the sound proof is really bad, the noise from the busy street and Gasibu park below is clearly heard in the room and its really dissapointing for a 5* hotel. The parking lots is huge, I guess its the biggest basement parking lot for a hotel in Bandung, maybe its because of next to the hotel is a convention center and they shared the same parking lot, and maybe if there's an event at the convention center then parking will be an issue.

Mohammad G.,9.4,29-Sep-21,"A pleasant stay in the middle of bandung. I booked the single room with a bathtub (required prior request) and the room exterior feels like an aged homey place. The hot water is available on specific times (5-9; 15-21), the bathtub drain plug is not available (you had to bring/make your own), the air conditioning remote required extra aim to be able to function. The bed was alright, it has one pillow. The exterior is well-maintained, a lot of breathing space and great gardens. This hotel has a ""kamartuju"" cafe which serves great ristresso and affogato, a must try. On weekend this is a bicycling spot where locals meet up so expect to see them on the cafe at 6-9 am. Didn't book with breakfast so cannot review the restaurant, but had own breakfast in the place and its very cozy. Lots of ventilation and morning breeze. The gate to jl gempol is not opened anymore which is unfortunate, but may be a required thing in these pandemic times. Weekend morning at jl gempol is very crowded nowadays.

I was grateful that I booked the double sky pod all for myself though, it was spacious for someone with a small figure like I am. I love how cold the pod was and how comfortable the bed was. Since I booked the sky one, it kind of made me feel a little bit adventurous, which I enjoyed. The bathroom was clean and thankfully not that far away from my pod. The warm water just hit different when I took a bath in the cold morning of Bandung. The communal space was okay, not that crowded and packed with people-again, which I enjoyed.

The housekeeping only replaced the the bad sheets, they didn't even clean the room nor bathroom. The AC was not working properly, we had hard time sleeping. Asked them to fix the AC but they did little to nothing. Breakfast was so so. Little parking space. Covid protocol was terrible, most of the guests did not wear any mask in lobby and restaurant. Sad sad stay. We actually booked for Two nights, but only stayed for one, got the second night refunded and moved to a better hotel. It ' s very unfortunate because this hotel used to be very Good. Used to stay here few years ago and it was very pleasing, but not this time. Sad to see what happened to this hotel. In 2016/17 the room here used to cost around $ 70-$100/night now it only costs $ 35, half the price. Judging by that I can clearly say it ' s because of the degradation of quality. Maybe because of pandemic? We'll never know. If you want a pleasant stay for/under $ 50, I suggest look for newer modern hotels to stay like Moxy hotel, hotel 101 or any other budget hotel.

Their TV program and wifi also disappointing, wifi was slow, troubled TV channels. The room was not as clean. Also, we have to ask for the slippers. Other than that it was okay.

And its very spacious for myself alone. The bathroom has a bathtub and separated shower (which is really nice), they provide a shampoo & liquid soap, and also towels. But they do not provide toothbrush and toothpaste, (which is actually okay for me, because I always bring mine) but in case you don’t have it with you, buy one travel toothbrush and toothpaste, it won’t be expensive anway. The location, it is located nearby the ITB University. So do not have to be worry about food, you’ll find plenty around the area. Everything in this place is great. Just a little note that the parking lots is limited, so you might park outside the building on busy days (but it is safe tho, I parked mine outside too at the time). And also if you’re planning to go outside or come back to the hotel / guesthouse a little late, you might need to let the receptionist or the keeper know before you leave. So that you won’t locked outside like I experienced. Long story short, it’s all good with a little notes here and there. Enjoy your stay!",Rumah Aca,GUEST HOUSES
Sry R. S.,9.4,22-Nov-18,"When I first arrived the main door is closed and I just follow to the only open door which is the garage door. Luckily there is someone there to guide me, and as it turned out the guest house is mix with kost-kostan. So yea a little caution for you. As for the room itself, it is great as stated in the photo, I booked for the double room with private bathroom, all is good. The cleannes, freeflow water as they use galon, channel TV, free wifi, microwave, cooking tools, sink, all the things you need are provided. Worth the money I guess, though maybe it could be cheaper as there is no breakfast included. But it's all good. It is also close to lots of restaurants and warungs and ITB of course. Recommended.",Rumah Aca,GUEST HOUSES

Anggi P. K.,6.3,31-Aug-19,Super noisy! You can hear loud music from the bar especially if you stay on 2nd and 3rd floor. It is almost nonstop (they promised it will end by 2.30 am but still they didn't stop until around 3 am). Aren't hotels supposed to be place to sleep?,Hotel Riau Bandung,GUEST HOUSES
